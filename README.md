# lightbar

HTML, CSS & JS recreation of the Whelen Ultra Freedom lightbar, including the so-called 'H-ECU' controller.

## What is this?

The _Whelen Ultra Freedom_ is a lightbar fitted to most last-generation Dutch police cars. It is very modular, so it can be used in different configurations on different vehicles. The configuration portrayed here is the one used on the Volkswagen Touran.

The controller is a recreation of the 'H-ECU controller' made by the company Modiforce (formerly Honac Nederland).
